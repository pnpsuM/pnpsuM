- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pnpsuM
- In the graduate school of Dongguk University, I am researching SOC prediction of secondary batteries via deep learning approach.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on deep learning architecture design (especially secondary battery adaptive).
- I'm also interested in Discrete Mathematics and Software Engineering.
